# Patient Management System (Frontend UI)

This is a simple, responsive **Patient Management System** built using **HTML** and **CSS**, designed to simulate a basic interface for hospitals or clinics to manage patient records. It allows users to view existing patients and register new ones through a clean and organized layout.

---

## Project Description

The **Patient Management System** provides a structured interface for medical staff to:

 - View a list of registered patients.
-  Register new patients with basic details.
- Simulate a real-life administrative workflow in a healthcare setting.

This version is a **static frontend prototype**, ideal for UI/UX demos or as a foundation for connecting to a backend (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) later.

## Functionality

-  **Patient List Table**  
  Displays sample patient data (ID, Name, Age, Gender, Phone).

-  **Patient Registration Form**  
  Includes inputs for:
  - Full Name
  - Age
  - Gender (dropdown)
  - Phone Number

- Form uses basic HTML5 validation (`required`, `type="tel"` and `type="number"`).

---

## Features

-  **Responsive Design**: Scales well on desktops and tablets.
-  **Themed with Yellow & Brown Colors**: Clean and professional look using soft yellows and browns (as requested).
- **User-Friendly UI**: Clear navigation, readable fonts, and well-spaced layout.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures required data is provided before submission.
